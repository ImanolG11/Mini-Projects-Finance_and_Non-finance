        "*Compound Interest Calculator with Flexible Contributions and Compounding Frequency*\n",
        "\n",
        "This project consists of a Python-based compound interest simulator, designed to model investment growth under different contribution and compounding schemes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The user can input an ***initial capital, annual interest rate, investment period, and periodic contributions*** (either annual or monthly).\n",
        "The program allows choosing whether ***contributions*** are made at the ***beginning or end of each period***, and supports both ***nominal and effective interest*** rate calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tool calculates and displays the final portfolio value, total amount contributed, and the resulting ***net profit***, showing how small changes in contribution timing or compounding frequency affect long-term returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**KEY-FEATURES**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Annual or monthly compounding\n",
        "*   User-defined contribution frequency (annual or monthly)\n",
        "*   Support for nominal and effective interest rate formulas.\n",
        "*   Option to invest contributions at the beginning or end of each period\n",
        "*   Real-time calculation of total invested capital and net profit\n",
        "*   Input validation and error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Final Reflection**\n",
        "\n",
        "This project has been a valuable introduction to combining programming with financial analysis.\n",
        "Through the development of a compound interest calculator, I learned how to translate key investment concepts — such as compounding frequency, contribution timing, and nominal versus effective interest rates — into functional Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process strengthened my understanding of control flow, error handling, and numerical computation, while also reinforcing fundamental financial principles related to compound growth and the time value of money.\n",
        "Although the current version already includes annual and monthly compounding, contribution flexibility, and net profit analysis, I do not consider the project completely finished.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the future, I intend to build upon this foundation by incorporating data visualization tools, automated data export, and more advanced financial modeling features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project has provided a strong foundation in both programming and financial reasoning, offering multiple possibilities for further development and refinement.\n",
